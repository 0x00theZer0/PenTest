# Host discovery
nmap -sn <target>
nmap -sn <target> | grep "report" | tr '()' ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f7 > hosts-list.txt   (creating a list of live hosts)
nmap -sn <target> | grep "report" | tr '()' ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f7 | xargs | tr ' ' ',' > hosts-csv.txt (csv hosts arg)
(or using my script "nmapHosts.sh" from Scripts/myScripts/)

# Stealth TCP SYN scan
nmap -sS <target>

# Version detection scan (not stealthy, full TCP scan)
nmap -sV <target>
nmap -sS -sV <target>

# List of Hosts
nmap <scan type> -iL hosts-list.txt
nmap -T4 -p- -iL hosts-list.txt -oN local.nmap

# Bypass a firewall that blocks Ping scanning
nmap -Pn -p 22,25,445,80,443,8080 <target>

# Spotting a firewall (when nmap fails to identify the version of a service [like http] or it responds tcpwrapped)
nmap -Pn -p 80 --reason <target>

## Masscan, designed to deal with large networks and scan thousands of IP addresses at once. A lot faster than nmap but a bit less accurate
